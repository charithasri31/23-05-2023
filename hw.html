    <h2 id="about" style="color:crimson;">About</h2>
    <p align="justify" style="color:rgb(8, 11, 28)">Nissankara Savitri was born on 6 December 1935[a] in a Telugu-speaking Kapu family[10][11] in Chirravuru, Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh.[9][12] Savitri was born to Nissankara Subhadramma and Guravayya.[9] Her father died when she was six months old, after which her mother took Savitri and an older sibling, Maruti to live with an aunt and uncle. Her uncle, Kommareddy Venkataramaiah enrolled her in classes when she began to show a talent for dance.She was named for the expression of her eyes during dramas. She participated in many dramas, in one where she was rewarded with a garland by the famous actor Prithviraj Kapoor. She, along with her uncle, went to the Vijaya Vauhini studio in Chennai to enroll Savitri as a character in a movie, though they refused to do so. Not giving up, they tried once again, in another cinema, where she managed to get a role, but could not stand it as she hesitated in reciting dialogues because she was in awe when talking to the hero.
    It was then that she met Ramaswamy Ganesan, also known as Gemini Ganesan, who took pictures of Savitri and instructed the duo that they come after two months. Defeated, Savitri went back to her village and continued playing dramas. On one specific day a man came to their home and asked Savitri to play a role for his cinema. Savitri's career thus began. Savitri married Tamil actor Gemini Ganesan in 1952, having first met him in 1948. The marriage led to a permanent rift with her uncle because Ganesan was already married, had four daughters, and was involved in an affair with Pushpavalli.[1] Her marriage became public when she signed a photograph as Savitri Ganesh.[13] Ganesan later acknowledged that he had two daughters with Pushpavalli while married to Savitri, with whom he had a daughter and a son.</p>
    <h2 id="bio" style="color:crimson;">Biography</h2>
    <p align="justify" style="color:rgb(8, 11, 28)">Savitri acted in dance dramas as a child, including some work with a theatre company run by Jaggayya. She made an unsuccessful speculative trip to find film work in Madras at the age of 14 when she was deemed to be too young to play heroine roles, but in 1950 was cast as the female lead in Samsaram. That role did not become actuality because she became too excited, necessitating numerous retakes and eventually her replacement in the part. She was given a minor speaking role in the film and in the next year had two more minor roles, in Roopavati and Patala Bhairavi, before getting her big break as the second heroine in Pelli Chesi Choodu. She, later on, was propelled to stardom with critically acclaimed roles in blockbusters such as Devadasu and Missamma.[1]
    Director PC Reddy who directed Savitri says, “there is none who can equal her beauty and talent. She didn’t heed anyone’s advice and got married very early. I remember she was so addicted to drinking even on the sets; she threw up on my shirt during a shoot. The next day she got a brand new shirt for me. She was a generous woman.” Savitri also worked in Bollywood films, although she did not find much success.[1] Her only Malayalam film was Chuzhi (1973).[14]
    Her performance in the 1957 film Mayabazar skyrocketed her to stardom. She later went on to become the highest-paid and most sought-after South-Indian actress of her generation. Savitri was known for her hospitality, philanthropic gestures, and love of buying property and jewelry, but she kept little control of her spending. Ganesan continued to philander and she was susceptible to favoring hangers-on with her largesse. In 1960, she received the Rashtrapati Award which later became "National Award for the Best Actress" for her performance in the Telugu film Chivaraku Migiledi. In 1968, she produced and directed the Telugu film Chinnari Papalu, for which she received the state Nandi Award for Best Feature Film(Silver). Her career took a downturn in the late 1960s. Her properties were seized by tax officials in the 1970s and she turned to act in any film in her later years, while sycophants encouraged her to direct and produce films that were unsuccessful and financially draining. Among her few supporters during her financial troubles were Dasari Narayana Rao, who cast her in most of his films, such as Gorintaku (1979), and specifically made Devadasu Malli Puttadu (1978) as a movie for her.[15]
    Savitri was also one of the top Tamil actresses of her era. She acted with major stalwarts, such as M.G.R, Sivaji Ganesan and her husband, Gemini Ganesan, mostly with the latter. Her notable Tamil works include Kalathur Kannamma (1959), Pasamalar (1961), Pava Mannippu (1961), Paarthal Pasi Theerum (1962), Karpagam (1963), Karnan (1963), Kai Koduttha Dheivam, Navarathri (1964), and Thiruvilaiyadal (1965).</p>

    <p align="justify" style="color:rgb(8, 11, 28)">Savitri and Gemini Ganesan's love story is something that has piqued the interest of youngsters, thanks to the success of Mahanati/Nadigaiyar Thilagam. While the film is a two-hour-odd documentation of Savitri's rise and fall as an actress, the film has also unearthed a lot of information about Gemini Ganesan's life.
    In Mahanati, the way Dulquer Salmaan (as Gemini Ganesan) glides into the life of Keerthy Suresh (as Savitri) was surreal and dreamy. And in no time, people started talking about their love story and Gemini Ganesan's multiple wives.Ramaswami Ganesan was a man of high hopes. In fact, he wanted to become a doctor and at the age of 19, he married Alamelu after his father promised Gemini that he'd help him achieve his dream. Sadly, his father-in-law passed away, a year after his marriage, thereby quashing his dreams. He then began to venture into films for a living.
    Since he worked with Gemini Studios as a casting assistant, he earned the sobriquet, Gemini Ganesan. When he was asked to interview film aspirants as part of an audition, he happened to meet budding actress Savitri. It was the first time they had met each other. According to reports, he appreciated Savitri's smile and filed her photographs with a promising note, "looks promising if given the opportunity."
    It was a brief meeting between the two and it took some time for Savitri and Gemini Ganesan to meet again. Meanwhile, both of them had figured a way out to get featured in films. By then, they had a few important films in their filmography.
    While Savitri got her due credit as a heroine with her Telugu film Pelli Chesi Choodu, Gemini Ganesan was an emerging star after his terrific performance as an antagonist in Thai Ullam.</p>
